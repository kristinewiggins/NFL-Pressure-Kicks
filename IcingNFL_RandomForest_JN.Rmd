Boruta is a feature selection algorithm. Precisely, it works as a wrapper 
algorithm around Random Forest.

Variables in order of importance with description. Importance is a measure of 
by how much removing a variable decreases accuracy, and vice versa â€” by how much 
including a variable increases accuracy.
